A simple mutation script
==========================
This is a simple python script for 
mutation analysis. It can generate mutants
from source codes of C programs.

The orignal homepage of the script is 
http://arun-babu.com/. Unfortunately, 
it is unavailable now.


Usage
------------
```bash
./mutate.py <c file> -o <where to put mutants>
```

* Works better if comments are removed (decomment tool or gcc) and code is indented (indent tool)
